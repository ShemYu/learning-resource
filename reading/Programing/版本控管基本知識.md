# Learning of Version


## Name rule of Version

For example, version of some_project will set like this:
```
some_project ver. 1.2.3
```
1.2.3 means the version of **some_project**. 
- 1
    
    The first num of version call **major version**.
    Change when project have a major update which like add a new module.
- 2
    
    The second num of version call **minor version**.
    Add when the project update some package or function.

- 3

    The third num of version call **patch**.
    Add when the project Fixed some bug.
        
When patch deploy at GitHub, merge the develop branch to master(main, the lastest stable version of your project) and then checkout a new branch which named by version(e.g. 1.2.3), add a tag of version and write down the update descriptions.
