# Model serving

## What is serving 

Serving is how you apply a ML model after you've training.

Most common way is RPC server.

### Goals of model serving

- Online, low latency
- Multiple model in a single process
- Multiple version of a model laoded over time
- Compute cost varies in real-time to meet product demand
  - auto-scale with CloudML, Docker and K8S
- Aim for the efficiency of mini-batching at training time ...
  - except with requests arriving asynchronously
